## Population statistics of different European countries - a portfolio project.

This is a portfolio project. I was looking for a react app to build with an Api. When I stumbled on population.io, I made some vague scetches of the project I wanted to build. I made some conditions: it had to be react, react-dom and webpack and preferentially a bit of a goofy design.

I used:
- webpack
- sass
- react and react-router (goal)
- population.io as Api
- charts.js inside react bundler: react-charts-v2
